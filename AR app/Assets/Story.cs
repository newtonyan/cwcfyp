Since then, it has become one of the most iconic structures of CUHK. The appearance of the Gate of Wisdom resembles two fighters battling each other, which is a metaphor for fierce academic debates between scholars. There is a legend associated with the Gate of Wisdom, stating that students passing through the gate from the direction of the library will graduate with first class honour, while passing from the other direction will result in the inability in graduating (others say that passing through the gate from either direction will result in graduation with a miserable honour). Several major students movements also happened in the Gate of Wisdom, such as supporting the democratic movement in China in 1989 (June 4th Massacre) and the public consultation of the 2003 National Security Bill (Basic Law Article 23).";

The path leading to the lake from the University station is called the philosophy path, which encourages people to think about philosophy when they are taking a walk around the bridge. The red, octagon pavilion located at the centre is called the Lion Pavilion. The pond located next to the Lake Ad Excellentiam is called B德池 (Lake of the Cultivation of Virtue). It is also called B池 (Lake of the Cultivation of Ducks), which is a pun since the Cantonese pronunciation of “德” sounds like the English word “duck”. The names of the two bridges on the lake carry philosophical meanings: the Crooked Bridge and the Arched Bridge resemble the roller-coaster experience of everyone’s life.
